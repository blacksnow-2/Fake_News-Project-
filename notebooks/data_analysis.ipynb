to Rise is accurately citing a portion of a study by the Cato Institute that looked at one measure of spending for 48 of Americas governors in 2014. But Kasich disputes the study itself, and correctly notes that there are other ways to measure state spending, and that a shifting of dollars from one part of the budget to another affected the results. What to make of it all?This reminds us of some previous attempts to look at the spending records of governors running for president. And like in those cases, the result here might be a tad unsatisfying for people seeking clarity. Cato, in our judgment, did nothing to unfairly target Kasich.

But \\\"special-interest group\\\" is a broader -- if ill-defined -- category that includes lots of individual donors. By one rough estimate the amount could be 84 percent. By an even rougher estimate it could be 72 percent. Hinckley's 30 percent figure is way off the mark, which makes him ineligible for a True reading on the Truth-O-Meter. But our judges felt that, in this case, the data back up his point that Whitehouse is getting a significant amount of money from special interests. We will note, for the record, that while Hinckley is saying he has only gotten 1 percent of his money from special interests, the fact that 78 percent of his funds come from larger donors (not much different from Whitehouse's 84 percent) argues otherwise. A list of his donors by industry, we suspect, would also show a significant special-interest pattern, based on how Hinckley's campaign is defining special-interest money. However, OpenSecrets has not complied that list for Hinckley's donors because it doesn't have the resources to do every challenger, according to the organization.
