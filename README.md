Hi, this is Ishan, trying to complete a ML project, with its topic being Fake News Detection. This project is completely based on the Step-by-step fake-new detection by Mihail Eric, so it's been learn-on-the-go project. A lot of terms, concepts are going to be learnt by me, through this advanced project, so good luck for me!!!!!!
The fake_new_master folder is the original version of the code implemented by the mentor himself, and the rest are mine.

Due to some file access related issues, it has been made to work in google colab only, by uploading all the files, including the datasets. DVC won't work, only necessary commands are in dvc.yaml .
